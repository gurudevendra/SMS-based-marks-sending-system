# Automatic Marks Sending System to Students Through SMS

# Project Overview
The Automatic Marks Sending System is an embedded system designed to automate the process of delivering student examination marks via SMS. The system uses a Raspberry Pi as the central controller and a GSM module to send marks directly to students’ registered mobile numbers, eliminating manual result communication.

# Academic Details
- Degree: B.Tech – Electronics and Communication Engineering  
- Project Type: Capstone / Final Year Project  
- Institution: Audisankara College of Engineering & Technology  
- Academic Year: 2024–2025  

# Objectives
- To automate student marks notification using SMS  
- To reduce manual effort and administrative workload  
- To ensure timely, accurate, and reliable result delivery  
- To improve efficiency in academic institutions  

# System Architecture
The Raspberry Pi retrieves student marks from a database, formats them into SMS content using Python scripts, and sends the messages through a GSM module using AT commands or Gammu. A push button can be used to manually trigger SMS transmission, and an LCD display shows system status.

# Technologies Used
- Embedded Systems  
- Raspberry Pi 3  
- Python Programming  
- GSM Communication (AT Commands)  
- Linux (Raspberry Pi OS)  
- Database (MySQL / SQLite)  

# Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 3  
- GSM800L GSM Module  
- SIM Card  
- 16×2 LCD Display (without I2C)  
- Push Button  
- Power Supply (5V & 12V adapters)  
- Connecting Wires  

# Software Requirements
- Raspberry Pi OS (Linux)  
- Python  
- Gammu / Minicom  
- Serial Communication Libraries  

# Working Procedure
1. Teachers enter student marks into the database  
2. Raspberry Pi fetches marks using Python scripts  
3. Marks are formatted into SMS text  
4. GSM module sends SMS to registered mobile numbers  
5. LCD displays system status  
6. Button allows manual control of SMS transmission  

# Features
- Automatic SMS-based marks delivery  
- Fast and reliable communication

- Academic institutions  
- Education automation systems  

# Future Scope
- Web-based marks entry system  
- Attendance notification via SMS  
- Cloud database integration  
- Mobile application support  
- OTP-based authentication  

# Team Role
- Project design and documentation  
- Hardware integration and testing  
- Python scripting and GSM configuration  
- System implementation and result analysis  

# Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates an automated, cost-effective, and reliable solution for sending student marks through SMS. By integrating embedded systems with GSM communication, the system improves academic result management and reduces administrative workload.
